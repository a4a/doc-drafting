Notes about the model implementation

1) Develop new class based on FLAssess or FLModel to store model parameters instead of using environments.
2) Develop predict and residuals methods
3) Possibility to turn off verbose
4) Looks like there are problems with ~virgin stocks. The problem seems to be the SepVPA that estimates f=0 which are log afterwards and become -inf. !! FIXED !!
5) Why not estimating f for the last age? if it's a plus group than report previous age f.
